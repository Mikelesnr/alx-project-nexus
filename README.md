- Kuberneties
- Swagger
- Sql
- postgress sql

# Important backend development concepts:

- green blue deployment -> where a company releases a new vesion of an app while the old one is still active then the reroute trafic and in the event of an issue witht the new branch they can return the traffic to the old version.

- setting up git actions for CI/CD development.

- creating automation scripts

# Challenges faced and solutions implemented

- documentation can sometimes be a bit confusing especially if it is a lot and you are reading after a full day of work. my solution to this was to ask chat gpt to explain the concepts I didn't quite understand.

# Best practices and personal takeaways

- Cors mananment in django and setting allowed hosts on deployment with django
- automating tests
